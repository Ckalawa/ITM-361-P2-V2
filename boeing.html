        <img class="b737" src="images/737.png" alt="Boeing 737 gif documenting the history of the jet">
        <p>The most popular jet in the world, the 737 is the definition of a workhorse. The face of the SouthWest fleet (one of the largest airlines to only use one aircraft family), the 737 is most likely the airplane that will be flying over you. The 737 like its competitors the A320 has also gone under a next-gen upgrade the MAX family (which has already had a shaky histroy). The 737 has a max capacity of 210 passangers, a max take off weight of 200000 lbs, and a max range of 4500 miles</p>

        <p>Nicknamed the Queen of the Skies. The 747 was the worlds first jumbojet, and is one of the largest planes in active service behind the C-5 and A380.

        <img class="b757" src="images/757.png" alt="Boeing 757 in standard luftansa livery">
        <p>The 757 is possibly the most overpowered aircrat in the world. Equipped with 2 rolls Royce turbofans, the 757 was originally designed to operate off small runways and at heigher takeoff altitudes. This jet also has a unique role as Air Force Two, transporting the VP and other cabinet level psoitions, and sometimes the President when the airport is too small for the 747. This jet also happens to be my favorite jetliner. The 757 has a max capacity of 295 passangers, a max take off weight of 124000 lbs, and a max range of 4500 miles.  </p>
