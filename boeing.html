            <p>The 757 is possibly the most overpowered aircrat in the world. Equipped with 2 rolls Royce turbofans, the 757 was originally designed to operate off small runways and at heigher takeoff altitudes. This jet also has a unique role as Air Force Two, transporting the VP and other cabinet level psoitions, and sometimes the President when the airport is too small for the 747. This jet also happens to be my favorite jetliner.</p>
